# `@angular-eslint/template/mouse-events-have-key-events`

[Accessibility] Ensures that the mouse events `mouseout` and `mouseover` are accompanied by `focus` and `blur` events respectively. Coding for the keyboard is important for users with physical disabilities who cannot use a mouse, AT compatibility, and screenreader users. See more at https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard

- Type: suggestion

<br>

## Rationale

Users who rely on keyboards for navigation (due to physical disabilities, personal preference, or assistive technologies) need keyboard alternatives for mouse-based interactions. Any element with a click or mouse event handler should also respond to keyboard events (typically keyup or keydown for Enter or Space keys). If an element is not inherently keyboard-accessible (like a div or span), consider using a button element instead, which is keyboard-accessible by default. This ensures your application is usable by everyone, not just mouse users. This is a WCAG Level A requirement.
