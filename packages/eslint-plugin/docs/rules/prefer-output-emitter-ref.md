# `@angular-eslint/prefer-output-emitter-ref`

Use `OutputEmitterRef` instead of `@Output()`

- Type: suggestion

<br>

## Rationale

The output() function is Angular's modern, signal-based API for component outputs, replacing the @Output() decorator. OutputEmitterRef (returned by output()) provides better type safety, integrates seamlessly with Angular's signal ecosystem, and offers a more functional programming approach. Unlike @Output() which uses EventEmitter, output() is specifically designed for component outputs and has a cleaner, more predictable API. The signal-based approach also provides better performance characteristics and enables better tree-shaking. As Angular moves toward signal-based reactivity, using output() aligns with the framework's direction and ensures your components are ready for future Angular features that leverage signals.
