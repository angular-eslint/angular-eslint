# `@angular-eslint/prefer-output-emitter-ref`

Use `OutputEmitterRef` instead of `@Output()`

- Type: suggestion

<br>

## Rationale

The output() function is Angular's modern API for component outputs, intended to be used instead of the @Output() decorator (which still exists for backwards compatibility). OutputEmitterRef (returned by output()) provides better type safety, integrates seamlessly with Angular's signal ecosystem, and offers a more functional programming approach. Unlike @Output() which uses EventEmitter, output() is specifically designed for component outputs and has a cleaner, more predictable API, that resembles other function based and signals APIs that have been added to the framework in recent versions.
