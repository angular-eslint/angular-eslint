This issue template is only for problems specifically with the `@angular-eslint/utils` package.
That means you should only use this template if there are problems with the utilities for creating Angular ESLint rules.

If you have a problem with a specific lint rule, please back out and select the `@angular-eslint/eslint-plugin` or `@angular-eslint/eslint-plugin-template` issue template, depending on where the rule lives.

**Versions**

| package                            | version |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- |
| `@typescript-eslint       `        | `X.Y.Z` |
| `TypeScript`                       | `X.Y.Z` |
| `ESLint`                           | `X.Y.Z` |
| `node`                             | `X.Y.Z` |

^ **Before submitting the issue** please check that output from `ng version` carefully.

Is there any inconsistency between your major version numbers? E.g. if you see `@angular-devkit/core` at version `7.x.x` but your `@angular/cli` is a version `11.x.x` it makes sense that you would be experiencing issues.

It's not clear how workspaces can end up in this state, but fixing it is just a case of installing the correct versions that are intended to work together and verifying the `ng version` output once again.

- [ ] I have updated to the latest supported version of the packages and checked my `ng version` output per the instructions given here.
