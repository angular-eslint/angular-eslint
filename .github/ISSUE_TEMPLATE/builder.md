**Versions**

| package                            | version |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- |
| `@angular-eslint/builder`          | `X.Y.Z` |
| `ESLint`                           | `X.Y.Z` |
| `node`                             | `X.Y.Z` |

<!--
^ **Before submitting the issue** please check that output from `ng version` carefully.

Is there any inconsistency between your major version numbers? E.g. if you see `@angular-devkit/core` at version `7.x.x` but your `@angular/cli` is a version `11.x.x` it makes sense that you would be experiencing issues.

It's not clear how workspaces can end up in this state, but fixing it is just a case of installing the correct versions that are intended to work together and verifying the `ng version` output once again.

- [ ] I have updated to the latest supported version of the packages and checked my `ng version` output per the instructions given here.
